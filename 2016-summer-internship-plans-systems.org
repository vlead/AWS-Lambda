* Goals and intentions
+ Suggest a strategy to shift our architecture from AWS VMs to either AWS Lambda or AWS Docker.
+ Document learning and come up with a solution addressing Performance,
  security, scalability, cost benefits and other important parameters of using Docker or Lambda.
+ Compare current AWS VM architecture with possibilities in Docker and Lambda. 

* Role of Mentor/Supervisor
+ Conducting or helping interns in induction program.
+ Assist interns to settle transition with new technologies and environment.
+ Take session in productive way, with more hands-on and least spoon feeding.
+ Share required knowledge with interns so that they can proceed ahead with assignments.
+ Communicate regulary with interns and listen to their views and concerns.
+ Propose a plan every week, on how to proceed ahead with coming week.
+ Review documents created by interns including their work reports and other documents to verify their learning.
+ Let interns feel comfortable and calm to inculcate positive outlook for the different assignments given to them.

* Role of an Intern
+ Contribute in the respective projects assigned.
+ Properly document learning in mentioned format and get it reviewed from mentor.
+ Understand the plan decided by mentors and raise concerns if any.
+ Do not freez and communicate mentors after applying enough efforts.

* Expectations from interns after accomplishment of internship
Project kept under Systems are more of exploration. Interns are expected to have thorough understanding on the project 
assigned to them and must be able to put up a nice presentation.
We have our current architecture in AWS. Interns are expected to compare AWS VM, AWS Lambda and AWS Docker architecture in the following concerns(Please add more factors if required) -
** Performance 
Our current architecture with AWS VMs is giving high degree of performance in terms of availablity, zero downtime, easy of handling, scalability and 
security. Cost optimization is the concern as wit every VM, the AWS billing is increaing. If we can acheive same performance, with either AWS Docker 
or AWS Docker, can we acheive cost optimization.
** Cost
Cost of Current arcitecture in form of AWS VM is not feasible and is increaing exponentially. This is a pain area and as per the suggestions
AWS Lambda and AWS Docker can reduce it to a nice extent.
** Ease of Handling
How easy it would be to handle tecnical issues. 
** Scalability
In current AWS VM architecture, one can easily add, remove and add a new VM without disturbing exsting VMs. This ease of scalability is to be
defined in terms of AWS Lambda or AWS Docker 
** Security
AWS VMs are secured and all the security issues are implicitly handled by AWS. We only add ACLs and key based authentication to VMs.
How secure will be AWS Lambda or Docker ? Are there some security flaws observed in both Lambda and Docker ??

** Robustness of architecture
Minor changes should not result in disturbance to healthy running component.
AWS being a gaint in cloud could have taken care of this.

* Week wise plan(only for upcoming week)
** Bootcamp(week 1 to week 3) [May 16,2016 ,June 5 2016]
   First 3 weeks includes a similiar plan for all interns. 
   An induction/boot camp will be conducted for an ice breaking session with
   individuals and also to introduce them with new technologies used in Virtual Labs. 
** Week 4 
**** Basics of networking and networking in linux
This session is required to introduce interns with terms which will be used
while working in systems project. This can include the following -
+ IP addressing and subnet mask
+ Basic linux commands to check networking related issues.
+ Basic linux commands to work in Linux environment 

**** Introduce interns with VLEAD assests on web, which can be referred/used 
+ VLEAD wiki, which can be accessed using LDAP credentials and contains notes 
+ Point to notes on sbarjatiya.com whenever required

**** Concepts of Virtualization 
Interns must have clear understanding on virtualization concepts.  
**** Introduce OpenVZ 
Handson practice of openVz, to have a feel of container based virtualization.
**** Introduce Virtual labs on Cloud
In dept information may not be required, but - 
+ Introduction to all the components of our cluster.
+ Introdution to base machines 

**** Introduce to VLEAD private cloud and its components
For interns to understand our private cloud infrastructure is necessary. With this,
they will get an idea to compare their task with what we have today.

**** Introduce Systems model
Introducing interns with our System's model is important for giving an initial
walk for expected pace.  This complete procedure will include sessions for all
major technologies required to work in Systems environment of VLEAD.



 
**** Introduce Docker  
This includes basic introduction to what docker is.
** Week 5
**** Install docker 
This exercise is to install docker in local machine  
**** Learn Docker fundamentals
Understand the terms related to docker and difference in them. 
**** Learn Docker operations
Learn basic commands related to operate docker 
**** Hands-on Docker 
Apply basic commands on local machine to play with docker images and container.
